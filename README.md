# Dependency Update Bot

The Dependency Update Bot is a developer tool that automates the process of updating dependencies in your software project. It helps you stay up to date with the latest versions of libraries, frameworks, and other dependencies used in your codebase.

## Features

- **Dependency Monitoring**: Automatically scans your project's codebase and tracks the dependencies specified in package configuration files.
- **Version Monitoring**: Regularly checks official repositories or package registries for updates to your tracked dependencies.
- **Compatibility Checks**: Runs automated tests or checks after updating dependencies to identify any compatibility issues or conflicts.

3. Run the bot's update command to initiate the dependency update process. Choose whether you want to update all functionalities or selectively choose specific ones.
4. The bot will scan your codebase, check for updates, and generate a report highlighting available updates.
5. Review the report and choose whether to proceed with the updates.
6. After updating dependencies, the bot can run compatibility checks, executing tests or checks to identify any issues.
